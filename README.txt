Your bot needs to be either P1.py or P2.py, I've already setup the id and name so that yours is P1
I've written them with the most basic AI, (random free spots)
the only code you need to change is in the move method, it has some comments to help with referencing board coords properly

to run it, run the command

python tictactoe.py
